    <h2>How aryan invasion theory made Indians to disregard their own gloroious past</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 3vw;">
        People of india often regard the history they are taught in the schools as Mythology. People don't often care to dive deep into the meaning of the term "Mythology" . If we dive deep into the meaning of the word we would notice how colonial powers used our own history against us in a twisted manner to colonise the people of india.

        India had a state funded education system in the past , the whole education system was based on meritocracy of the attendee unlike india's present . Ever noticed why India has so  many temples because temples were center of the glorious native indian education system , where students had proper access to bhakti to increase their focus and an open environment for a proper setting of the environment suitable for education. 
        When the colonial power colonised the people of india , they forcefully imposed their macmilian education system which imposed the culture of mugging up on indian people , hence limiting their capacity to think and grow . Still i wonder why the education system has not been updated or changed 
        India was center to world class universities such as nalanda , taxilla etc but during the turkish invasion they were burned down , it has been said that when library of nalanda was burned it burned for almost 3 months , The knowledge in the library could have helped florished the mankind more sooner , and yet people say that indians didn't write their own histroy . We had more knowledge that the all the civilisations combined but they were burned down and this fact was used against us to manipulate and colonise the people of india.

        The aryan invasion theory regards that the aryans from the west invaded india and pushed back the "Dravidians" to the south of the subcontinent , but according to genetic data and archealogical evidences , their was never a aryan invasion because no traces of war have been found and the search is still on . 
        So the aryan invasion theory was renamed or ammended as the aryan migration theory but according to the archealogical books , aryans never migrated from the west if they did we would have observed a socio-cultural shift in the indian culture , but there was none . 
        So the Historians from the west ammended the theory that aryan migration took place but in small numbers such that it didn't affect the socio-cultural scenario of indians. Sounds totally base less 

        We should completely Disregard the aryan invasion theory because it is falsifying the glorious past of indians . There is another theory (Indo-aryan expansion ) which describes that the aryans from india migrated to the west and bought about socio-cultural changes in the west , this can be confirmed from the languages used in the west as its just modified version of sanskrit . 
        Many people won't know that the word FATHER HAS IT ORIGINS FROM sanskrit word PITA , this change was mainly due to people not being able to pronounce the words in sanskrit .
        
        Did you know the Word ZEN came from the sanskrit word of focus.

    <h2>ARYAN INVASION THEORY AND RIGVEDA</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 3vw;">
        We all know the fact that rigveda is the oldest text ever written dated back to 1500 B.C. as established by the aryan invasion theory.
        We found many texts in rigveda related to the famous river of SARASWATI , it has been established through geological evidences that SARASWATI was not a mythical river , it flowed and dried up . It was made mythical by the colonial powers .
        
        SARASWATI dried up around 7000 years ago , but rigveda has enormous mentions of it , when we take these facts into considerations we reach the conclusion that RIGVEDA WAS WRITTEN AROUND 9000 YEARS ago when saraswati flowed magically .  

        This agains proves that how historians from the west used our own text against us to colonise us till date i.e. by falsifying the glorious past of indians.

        When people where still in stone age (Greek , European , Chinese , Persian civilisations) we had written the most scared text , followed till date .

    <h2>ARYAN INVASION THEORY AND AGE OF OUR CIVILISATION</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 3vw;">
        According to the aryan invasion theory the second population burst after africa happened from europe , this statement has nothing to support itself.

        If we Read the genetic research paper on the indian genes we can confirm that the indian gene has been residing in the indian sub continent since 50000 years and the population burst happened from india , that means majority of the global population have their origins traced back to india.
        Yeah invasion happened but not into india but from india , which shaped the course of humanity because they have the same common genetic lineage.  

        Common genetic lineage also shows that the concepts of dravidians and aryans are just myths created by colonial powers. This also proves their was no high caste low caste divide in india which is extensively taught in indian history books . 

        We had a glorious past which are supported by various scientific theories but was disregared by the aryan invasion theory which is just blunt without evidences . Sanskrit has originated from india which shaped the course of humanity

        Entire west is invested in promoting this narrative using the power of money and propaganda. We are still colonised by the colonial power , just here we are masters of our own
