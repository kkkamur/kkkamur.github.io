    <h1>LEARNING JOURNEY</h1>
    <p style="font-size:  2vw;"> 
        Hey guys , I have another thing to annoy you all 
        I love to code and i thought why not gave web development a 
        solid try. Again! 
        I would be learning to develop first static websites and then
        dynamic websites by annoying you all . 
        So here it begins from scratch to pro in 90days , i will try to 
        keep up my pace and update the website daily with new learned 
        features.
        Let the learning begin &#128518;.
    </p>
